\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This header for the Launch\+Darkly C++ Client-\/side SDK has moved!

Please use \textquotesingle{}\mbox{\hyperlink{client-sdk_2include_2launchdarkly_2client__side_2bindings_2c_2config_2builder_8h}{launchdarkly/client\+\_\+side/bindings/c/config/builder.\+h}}\textquotesingle{} instead.

The original C++ Client-\/side 1.\+0 release shipped builder.\+h at this location, but it was moved to the client\+\_\+side subdirectory to accommodate the C++ Server-\/side SDK.
