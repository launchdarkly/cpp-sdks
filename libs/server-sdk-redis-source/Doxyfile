# Doxyfile 1.8.17

# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project.
#
# All text after a double hash (##) is considered a comment and is placed in
# front of the TAG it is preceding.
#
# All text after a single hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored.
# The format is:
# TAG = value [value, ...]
# For lists, items can also be appended using:
# TAG += value [value, ...]
# Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (\" \").

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Project related configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This tag specifies the encoding used for all characters in the configuration
# file that follow. The default is UTF-8 which is also the encoding used for all
# text before the first occurrence of this tag. Doxygen uses libiconv (or the
# iconv built into libc) for the transcoding. See
# https://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/ for the list of possible encodings.
# The default value is: UTF-8.

DOXYFILE_ENCODING      = UTF-8

# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded by
# double-quotes, unless you are using Doxywizard) that should identify the
# project for which the documentation is generated. This name is used in the
# title of most generated pages and in a few other places.
# The default value is: My Project.

PROJECT_NAME           = "C++ Server-Side SDK Redis Source"

# Using the PROJECT_BRIEF tag one can provide an optional one line description
# for a project that appears at the top of each page and should give viewer a
# quick idea about the purpose of the project. Keep the description short.

PROJECT_BRIEF          = "Provide SDK data via Redis"

# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) path
# into which the generated documentation will be written. If a relative path is
# entered, it will be relative to the location where doxygen was started. If
# left blank the current directory will be used.

OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       = docs

# If you use STL classes (i.e. std::string, std::vector, etc.) but do not want
# to include (a tag file for) the STL sources as input, then you should set this
# tag to YES in order to let doxygen match functions declarations and
# definitions whose arguments contain STL classes (e.g. func(std::string);
# versus func(std::string) {}). This also make the inheritance and collaboration
# diagrams that involve STL classes more complete and accurate.
# The default value is: NO.

BUILTIN_STL_SUPPORT    = YES

# When TYPEDEF_HIDES_STRUCT tag is enabled, a typedef of a struct, union, or
# enum is documented as struct, union, or enum with the name of the typedef. So
# typedef struct TypeS {} TypeT, will appear in the documentation as a struct
# with name TypeT. When disabled the typedef will appear as a member of a file,
# namespace, or class. And the struct will be named TypeS. This can typically be
# useful for C code in case the coding convention dictates that all compound
# types are typedef'ed and only the typedef is referenced, never the tag name.
# The default value is: NO.

TYPEDEF_HIDES_STRUCT   = YES

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the input files
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The INPUT tag is used to specify the files and/or directories that contain
# documented source files. You may enter file names like myfile.cpp or
# directories like /usr/src/myproject. Separate the files or directories with
# spaces. See also FILE_PATTERNS and EXTENSION_MAPPING
# Note: If this tag is empty the current directory is searched.

INPUT                  = include src docs

# The RECURSIVE tag can be used to specify whether or not subdirectories should
# be searched for input files as well.
# The default value is: NO.

RECURSIVE              = YES

# If the USE_MDFILE_AS_MAINPAGE tag refers to the name of a markdown file that
# is part of the input, its contents will be placed on the main page
# (index.html). This can be useful if you have a project on for instance GitHub
# and want to reuse the introduction page also for the doxygen output.

USE_MDFILE_AS_MAINPAGE = ./docs/doc.md
