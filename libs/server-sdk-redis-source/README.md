The LaunchDarkly Server-Side SDK Redis Source for C/C++ is designed for use with the Server-Side SDK.

This component allows the Server-Side SDK to retrieve feature flag configurations from Redis, rather than
from LaunchDarkly.

LaunchDarkly overview
-------------------------
[LaunchDarkly](https://www.launchdarkly.com) is a feature management platform that serves trillions of feature flags
daily to help teams build better software, faster. [Get started](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/docs/getting-started)

Compatibility
-------------------------

This component is compatible with POSIX environments (Linux, OS X, BSD) and Windows.

Getting started
---------------

Download a release archive from
the [Github releases](https://github.com/launchdarkly/cpp-sdks/releases?q=cpp-server-redis&expanded=true) for use in
your project.

Refer to the [SDK documentation][reference-guide] for complete instructions on
installing and using the SDK.

### Incorporating the Redis Source

The component can be used via a C++ or C interface and can be incorporated via a static library or shared object. The
static library and shared object each have their own use cases and limitations.

The static library supports both the C++ and C interface. When using the static library, you should ensure that it is
compiled using a compatible configuration and toolchain. For instance, when using MSVC, it needs to be using the same
runtime library.

The C++ API does not have a stable ABI, so if this is important to you, consider using the shared object with the C API.

The shared library (so, DLL, dylib), only supports the C interface.

The examples here are to help with getting started, but generally speaking this component should be incorporated using
your
build system (CMake for instance).

### CMake Usage

When configuring the SDK via CMake, you need to explicitly enable this component (example):

```
cmake -GNinja -D LD_BUILD_REDIS_SUPPORT=ON ..
```

It is disabled by default to avoid pulling in the `redis++` and `hiredis` dependencies that this component is
implemented with.

This will expose the `launchdarkly::server_redis_source` target.

Next, link the target to your executable or library:

```cmake
target_link_libraries(my-target PRIVATE launchdarkly::server_redis_source)
```

This will cause `launchdarkly::server` to be linked as well.

-----------

Read our [documentation](https://docs.launchdarkly.com) for in-depth instructions on configuring and using LaunchDarkly.
You can also head straight to
the [complete reference guide for this SDK][reference-guide].

Testing
-------

We run integration tests for all our SDKs using a centralized test harness. This approach gives us the ability to test
for consistency across SDKs, as well as test networking behavior in a long-running application. These tests cover each
method in the SDK, and verify that event sending, flag evaluation, stream reconnection, and other aspects of the SDK all
behave correctly.

Contributing
------------

We encourage pull requests and other contributions from the community. Read
our [contributing guidelines](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions on how to contribute to this SDK.

Verifying SDK build provenance with the SLSA framework
------------

LaunchDarkly uses the [SLSA framework](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/about) (Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts) to help developers make their supply chain more secure by ensuring the authenticity and build integrity of our published SDK packages. To learn more, see the [provenance guide](../../PROVENANCE.md). 

About LaunchDarkly
-----------

* LaunchDarkly is a continuous delivery platform that provides feature flags as a service and allows developers to
  iterate quickly and safely. We allow you to easily flag your features and manage them from the LaunchDarkly dashboard.
  With LaunchDarkly, you can:
    * Roll out a new feature to a subset of your users (like a group of users who opt-in to a beta tester group),
      gathering feedback and bug reports from real-world use cases.
    * Gradually roll out a feature to an increasing percentage of users, and track the effect that the feature has on
      key metrics (for instance, how likely is a user to complete a purchase if they have feature A versus feature B?).
    * Turn off a feature that you realize is causing performance problems in production, without needing to re-deploy,
      or even restart the application with a changed configuration file.
    * Grant access to certain features based on user attributes, like payment plan (eg: users on the ‘gold’ plan get
      access to more features than users in the ‘silver’ plan). Disable parts of your application to facilitate
      maintenance, without taking everything offline.
* LaunchDarkly provides feature flag SDKs for a wide variety of languages and technologies.
