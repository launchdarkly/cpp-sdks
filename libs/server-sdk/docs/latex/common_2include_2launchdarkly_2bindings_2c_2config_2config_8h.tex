\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This header for the Launch\+Darkly C++ Client-\/side SDK has moved!

Please use \textquotesingle{}launchdarkly/client\+\_\+side/bindings/c/config/config.\+h\textquotesingle{} instead.

The original C++ Client-\/side 1.\+0 release shipped config.\+h at this location, but it was moved to the client\+\_\+side subdirectory to accommodate the C++ Server-\/side SDK.
