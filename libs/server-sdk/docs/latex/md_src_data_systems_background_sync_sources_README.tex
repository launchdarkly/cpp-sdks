This directory contains data sources for use in the Background Sync system.

These sources implement {\ttfamily IData\+Synchronizer}, which provides an interface that allows for passing in an {\ttfamily IDestination} to which data updates should be sent.

There are two primary sources supported by the server-\/side SDK.

One is the \href{./streaming}{\texttt{ streaming}} source\+: it receives updates from a web-\/service (via Server-\/\+Sent Events).

The other is \href{./polling}{\texttt{ polling}}\+: it periodically hits an endpoint to retrieve a full payload of flag data.

By default, the SDK uses the streaming source. Users can optionally configure the polling source if streaming isn\textquotesingle{}t feasible or desired.
