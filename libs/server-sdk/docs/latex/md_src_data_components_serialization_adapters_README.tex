Contains utilities for converting from in-\/memory evaluation models to serialized models, and back again.

This is a useful building block for implementing various Bootstrapper/\+Synchronizers/\+Destinations.

For example, to build a new Destination that ferries data to Redis, you might pull the {\ttfamily JSONDestination} off the shelf.

It accepts memory models, serializes them, and forwards to any {\ttfamily ISerialized\+Destination}.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{IDestination -\/> (serialization step) -\/> ISerializedDestination}

\end{DoxyCode}


To handle pulling data out of Redis, use the {\ttfamily JSONSource}. It pulls from any {\ttfamily ISerialized\+Data\+Source}, deserializes it, and passes it back up by implementing {\ttfamily IData\+Source}.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{IDataSource <-\/ (deserialization step) <-\/ ISerializedDataSource}

\end{DoxyCode}


On the other hand, to build a new Bootstrapper that pulls JSON from a web service, you might pull the {\ttfamily JSONSource} off the shelf. It accepts JSON models, deserializes them, and forwards to any {\ttfamily IDestination}.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{ISerializedDestination -\/> (deserialization step) -\/> IDestination}

\end{DoxyCode}
