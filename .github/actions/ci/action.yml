# This is a composite to allow sharing these steps into other workflows.
# It isn't a shared workflow, because then it isn't convenient to add
# additional package-specific steps.

# The CMake project should follow a convention where the test project is
# gtest_LIBNAME for instance gtest_launchdarkly-cpp-common.
