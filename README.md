Various CMake options are available to customize the client/server SDK builds.

| Option                    | Description                                                                                                                                       | Default                                                | Requires                                  |

| `LD_DYNAMIC_LINK_BOOST`   | If building SDK as shared lib, whether to dynamically link Boost or not. Ensure that the shared boost libraries are present on the target system. | On (link boost dynamically when producing shared libs) | `LD_BUILD_SHARED_LIBS`                    |
| `LD_DYNAMIC_LINK_OPENSSL` | Whether OpenSSL is dynamically linked or not.                                                                                                     | Off  (static link)                                     | N/A                                       |

**Note:** _if building the SDKs as shared libraries, then unit tests won't be able to link correctly since the SDK's C++
symbols aren't exposed. To run unit tests, build a static library._

Basic usage example:

```bash
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake -G"Unix Makefiles" ..
```

Slightly more advanced example - build shared libraries, and don't build any of the testing components:

```bash
mkdir -p build  && cd build
cmake -G"Unix Makefiles" -DLD_BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=On -DBUILD_TESTING=Off ..
```

The example uses `make`, but you might instead use [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/),
MSVC, [etc.](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7.html)

## LaunchDarkly overview

[LaunchDarkly](https://www.launchdarkly.com) is a feature management platform that serves trillions of feature flags

## Testing

We run integration tests for all our SDKs using a centralized test harness. This approach gives us the ability to test
for consistency across SDKs. These tests cover each method in the SDK, and verify that event sending, flag evaluation, stream reconnection, and other aspects of the SDK all
behave correctly.

## Contributing

We encourage pull requests and other contributions from the community. Check out
our [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions on how to contribute to this SDK.

## About LaunchDarkly

- LaunchDarkly is a continuous delivery platform that provides feature flags as a service and allows developers to
  iterate quickly and safely. We allow you to easily flag your features and manage them from the LaunchDarkly dashboard.
  With LaunchDarkly, you can:
    - Roll out a new feature to a subset of your users (like a group of users who opt-in to a beta tester group),
      gathering feedback and bug reports from real-world use cases.
    - Gradually roll out a feature to an increasing percentage of users, and track the effect that the feature has on
      key metrics (for instance, how likely is a user to complete a purchase if they have feature A versus feature B?).
    - Turn off a feature that you realize is causing performance problems in production, without needing to re-deploy,
      or even restart the application with a changed configuration file.
    - Grant access to certain features based on user attributes, like payment plan (eg: users on the ‘gold’ plan get
      access to more features than users in the ‘silver’ plan). Disable parts of your application to facilitate
      maintenance, without taking everything offline.
- LaunchDarkly provides feature flag SDKs for a wide variety of languages and technologies.
