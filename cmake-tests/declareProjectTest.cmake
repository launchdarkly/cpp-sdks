# This file defines macros which can be used to setup
# new cmake project tests without introducing excessive boilerplate.

# declare_add_subdirectory_test(<name of test>):
#   Use when the test depends on launchdarkly via add_subdirectory.

# declare_find_package_test(<test name>):
#   Use when the test depends on launchdarkly via find_package.

# add_build_step(<test name>):
#   By default, the declare_* macros result in a test where "cmake -DSOMEVARIABLE=WHATEVER .."
#   (the cmake configure step) is invoked. This may be sufficient for a particular test,
#   for example testing that the configure step fails.
#   If the test should also invoke "cmake --build .", use this macro.

# require_configure_failure(<test name>):
#   Asserts that the cmake configure step should fail. For example, this would
#   happen if a required version of a dependency couldn't be satisfied with find_package.

# require_build_failure(<test name>):
#   Asserts that the cmake build step should fail.
